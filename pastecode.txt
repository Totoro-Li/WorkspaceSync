To create a Bash script that uses `wget` to download all URLs from a text file and places each download instance in a separate `tmux` pane (since `tmux` does not support tabs, we use panes within the same window), you can use the following script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the input file with URLs is provided
if [ "$#" -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <file_with_urls>"
    exit 1
fi

# Read the file with URLs
URL_FILE="$1"

# Create a new tmux session. The session will be named 'downloads'
tmux new-session -d -s downloads

# Read each URL from the file and create a pane for each download
while IFS= read -r URL; do
    # Create a new pane and run wget in it
    # '-d' detaches from the session
    # 'split-window' creates a new pane
    # '-h' splits horizontally, use '-v' for vertical splits
    tmux split-window -h "wget -c \"$URL\""
    # 'select-layout' makes sure the layout is even by re-arranging the panes
    tmux select-layout tiled
done < "$URL_FILE"

# After all URLs have been added, 'kill-pane' is used to close the original pane
# that was automatically created when the new session started
tmux kill-pane -t downloads:0.0

# Attach to the session
tmux attach -t downloads
```

You would save this script to a file, for example, `download_in_tmux.sh`, give it execute permissions using `chmod +x download_in_tmux.sh`, and then run it passing the path to the text file containing the URLs as an argument:

```bash
./download_in_tmux.sh gen1_zip_urls.txt
```

This script assumes that:
- You have `wget` and `tmux` installed on your system.
- You are not running it as root (as it's usually not recommended to run `wget` as root for security reasons).
- The URLs in the file are absolute URLs and are each on a new line.

The script works by:
- Creating a new detached `tmux` session named "downloads".
- Reading each URL from the provided file and opening a new `tmux` pane for each one to start the `wget` download.
- After setting up all panes, it removes the original pane that was automatically created when the new session started.
- Finally, it attaches to the `tmux` session, allowing you to view the progress of all downloads.
