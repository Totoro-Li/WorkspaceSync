# Dataset Evaluation Results

This README summarizes the evaluation results for the dataset processed by our image comparison system. The dataset consists of multiple scenes, each containing ground truth (gt) and reconstruction image data. For each scene, the system computes the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) between the gt and the reconstruction data. These metrics are calculated for each pair of images whose timestamps differ by no more than 0.1 ms.

The results are stored in a `metrics.txt` file in the corresponding scene directory, containing the average PSNR and SSIM for that scene. 

An example `metrics.txt` file for a scene might look like this:

```
PSNR: 25.0
SSIM: 0.7
```

After processing all scenes, the system computes the average PSNR and SSIM across the entire dataset, which is stored in a `metrics.txt` file in the root dataset directory.

An example `metrics.txt` file for the dataset might look like this:

```
Average PSNR: 23.5
Average SSIM: 0.75
```

We encourage you to explore each scene's directory to understand the details of our evaluation.
